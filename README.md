What is CPTH?

It's the Competitive Programming Template Headers for C++.

It's not STL: It's for competitive programming.

It's not a collection of snippets: It's a collection of templates. No modification is required, just instantiation.

It's not a library: These are single-file headers, which is more convenient for competitive programming.

It's reliable, because all headers are tested with CI tests and code coverage reports.

You can see the full list of the current headers [here](HEADER_LIST.md).

## How to use?

Just paste the headers in the [headers](headers) directory at the beginning of your code.

Each file has a document in the [docs](docs) directory, you can read them and have a try.

The codes are based on C++11, there may be problems with other standards.
