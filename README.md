# CPTH

[![CI Test](https://github.com/ouuan/CPTH/workflows/CI%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ouuan/CPTH/actions)

What is CPTH?

It's the Competitive Programming Template Headers.

It's not STL: It's for competitive programming.

It's not a collection of snippets: It's a collection of templates. No modification is required, just instantiation.

It's not a library: These are single-file headers, which is more convenient for competitive programming.

## How to use?

Just paste the headers in the [headers](headers) directory at the beginning of your code.

Each file has a document, you can read them and have a try.

The codes are based on C++11, there may be problems with other standards.
