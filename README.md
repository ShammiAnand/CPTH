What is CPTH?

It's the Competitive Programming Template Headers for C++.

It's not STL: It's for competitive programming.

It's not a collection of snippets: It's a collection of templates. No modification is required, just instantiation.

It's not a library: These are single-file headers, which is more convenient for competitive programming.

You can see the full list of the current headers [here](HEADER_LIST.md).

## How to use?

Just paste the headers in the [headers](headers) directory at the beginning of your code.

Each file has a document in the [docs](docs) directory, you can read them and have a try.

The codes are based on C++11, there may be problems with other standards.
